# Native Backend Notes

QuietCooling currently uses `MockFanController` and `MockThermalSensorProvider`. This is deliberate: real fan control on modern Macs usually requires privileged access to SMC-like interfaces, model-specific handling, and careful failure behavior.

## Interfaces To Implement

Implement these protocols without changing the SwiftUI app or cooling policy:

- `FanControllerProtocol`
- `ThermalSensorProviderProtocol`

The native fan controller must support:

- `listFans()`
- `readFanRPM(fanID:)`
- `readFanMinMax(fanID:)`
- `setFanMinimumRPM(fanID:rpm:)`
- `releaseFanControl(fanID:)`
- `canControlFans()`
- `controlLimitationReason()`

The native sensor provider must support:

- `listSensors()`
- `readTemperature(sensorID:)`
- `readHottestRelevantTemperature()`

## Required Safety Behavior

- Never set a floor outside the reported fan range.
- Never lower the system's active safe behavior.
- Release to system on Off/System, very hot temperatures, quit, and backend failure.
- Report fanless, restricted, permission, helper, and sensor failures as user-facing statuses.
- Prefer the hottest relevant CPU package, SoC, GPU, or die sensor.

## Suggested Native Strategy

Start with a read-only backend that lists fans, RPM, ranges, and hottest sensor temperature. Only add write control after read behavior is stable and the app can prove it releases cleanly on quit and failure. If write access requires a helper, keep the helper API narrow: set minimum fan RPM and release fan control only.
